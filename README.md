# Autonomous-Car
in this project we built an Autonomous Car system with multiple integrated features using Arduino and FreeRTOS

In our embedded system project, we successfully developed a line-keeping car using Arduino and FreeRTOS. The project incorporated several key features, including MP3 modules for audio playback, touch screen controls, and an automatic light adjuster.

With meticulous planning and implementation, we utilized Arduino as the core platform, leveraging its capabilities to integrate various components and functionalities. By integrating FreeRTOS, we achieved real-time multitasking and precise task scheduling, optimizing the performance of the system.

The line-keeping car was designed to autonomously follow a predefined path, utilizing sensors to detect and track the line. This functionality allowed the car to navigate with accuracy and precision, enhancing its autonomous capabilities.

Furthermore, the project included a user-friendly touch screen interface, enabling users to control and interact with the car effortlessly. Through intuitive touch inputs, users could command the car's movement, playback audio files using the integrated MP3 modules, and adjust various settings.

To enhance the overall user experience and safety, an automatic light adjuster was implemented. This feature utilized sensors to detect ambient lighting conditions and dynamically adjust the car's headlights accordingly, ensuring optimal visibility during different environments.

Overall, this embedded system project showcased our proficiency in utilizing Arduino and FreeRTOS to create a feature-rich line-keeping car. Through the integration of MP3 modules, touch screen controls, and an automatic light adjuster, the project demonstrated our ability to design and implement complex embedded systems with a focus on functionality, user experience, and automation.
